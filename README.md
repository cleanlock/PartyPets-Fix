# PartyPets Fix [Dragonflight]

## What is this AddOn for!?

With the release of the Dragonflight Pre-Patch, pets in the Raid-Style PartyFrame are not showing up anymore, even tho the setting 'Display Pets' is enabled.

This AddOn fixes this issue by creating custom Pet Frames for the Raid-Style PartyFrame and shows the Party Pets again.

## Quick Start

- To open the configuration menu, type `/PPF` in your chat and hit enter.

Afterwards you'll have to set up the width (and height if you'd like to) to make it fit to your current Raid-Style Partyframe. You can also change the texture of the Pet frames.
